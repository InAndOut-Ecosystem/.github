# InAndOut

The core problem we address is the time spent shopping, where customers spend more time searching for products than actually purchasing them, leading to a fragmented and stressful shopping experience. By digitally mapping every aisle and shelf, we eliminate the guesswork, allowing you to walk directly to the exact location of any item, whether it is a specific brand of almond milk or a particular subcategory of dairy products.

Our solution transforms the traditional store into an interactive environment by linking product locations directly to your digital device through a "Stand" system. We calculate the most efficient path through the store using advanced mapping technology that understands floors, elevations, and corridor intersections, effectively acting as a personal GPS for your shopping list.

Beyond simple navigation, the platform integrates live availability and marketing insights to ensure your trip is productive and cost-effective. You can verify a store's specific operating hours for any day of the week before leaving home and instantly view active percentage-based offers or buy-one-get-one dependencies that apply specifically to the items on your list.
