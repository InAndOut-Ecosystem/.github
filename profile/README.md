# InAndOut

Our open-source solution directly addresses the significant **time wasted shopping**, which is primarily caused by customers struggling to locate products. This fragmented and stressful experience is eliminated by creating a digital map of every aisle and shelf. Shoppers can now **walk straight to the exact location of any item**, from a specific type of almond milk to a broader category of dairy products, without any guesswork.

The technical objective is building and deploying our custom service that solves the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)** in the context of our business model.
